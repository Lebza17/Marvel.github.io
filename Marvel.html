	<h3>Who is the Nightcrawler?</h3>
	
	<p>Kurt Wagner, aka Nightcrawler, has become one of the most enduringly popular characters in the X-Men universe. 
	That’s an especially impressive feat for a mutant who has largely not been a member of the main mutant squad, standing alongside longtime standards like Professor Xavier and Jean Grey.</p>

	<p>Whether it’s his distinctive look, his charming antics, or just his cool powers, we’re always happy to see more of the German acrobat. 
	So naturally, we’re excited about his upcoming return to the X-Men cinematic universe in this year’s X-Men: Apocalypse. 
	We haven’t seen Kurt in the film series since 2003 in X2: X-Men United, so some people might be a bit fuzzy on the fuzzy guy’s backstory</p>
